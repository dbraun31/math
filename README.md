# Resources for Learning Math

## Objective

This is a space that I'm dedicating to learning types of math that would be of benefit for
the type of work that I'm doing / I'm interested in doing. I'd like to move toward a true
mastery of statistics, probability, and modeling generally. A concrete example of an
objective I'd like to achieve is to be able to thoroughly understand something like
Chapter 5 of [this](bates_mixed_models.pdf) text on mixed models.

I'm making this directory public in the hopes that documenting my math adventures might be
of benefit to others.

## Approach

I anticipate this being a long road. The intention is to deeply learn the needed
mathematical fundamentals to lay a solid foundation for mastering the more complex modeling
topics.

I see probability theory as being a foundation upon which the other types of math I'm
interested in rest, so my primary aim will be to start by trying to really master probability
theory. I see the major prerequisites of probability theory being calculus and linear
algebra. I'll start with calculus, move to linear algebra, then to probability theory and
beyond.

### Cirriculum

**Phase 0: Brush up on the basics**

* Professor Leonard on YouTube ([notes](basics/leonard))

**Phase 1: Study single variable calculus**

* Get a foundation in real analysis
    * Work through Chapter 1 of Abbott's *Understanding Analysis*
        ([notes](real-analysis/))
* Work through Spivak's *Calculus* concurrently with taking the MIT open course on [single
    variable
    calculus.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/pages/syllabus/)

**Phase 2: Study multivariable calculus**

**Phase 3: Study linear algebra**

**Phase 4: Study probability theory**
