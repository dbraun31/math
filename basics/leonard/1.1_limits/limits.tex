\section{Limits}

Limits are the basis of calculus. There are two goals in calculus:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given any curve, find the slope of a curve at a point (find the tangent to a
        curve at a point).
    \item Given any curve defined by a function, can you between two points find the area
        under the curve?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tangent Problem}

If you give me an arbitrary curve, and give me a point $p$, I need to find the slope of
the curve at point $p$. If we have the slope and we have the point, we can make the
tangent line. \\

\emph{Tangent line.} A tangent line is a line that touches at exactly one point and is
"parallel to the curve at that point.\\

One problem if we only have one point and no slope is we can't draw a line---we need at
least one more point. We can find another point along the curve and connect the two to
form a secant line.\\

\emph{Secant line.} A secant line is a line that intersects a curve at two points (see
Figure \ref{fig:secant}).\\

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{secant.pdf}
    \caption{A secant line intersects two points on a curve.}
    \label{fig:secant}
\end{figure}

So in Figure \ref{fig:secant}, how could we come up with a secant line that's a better
approximation of the tangent line? We can incrementally move $g$ closer and closer to $p$
and observe that it becomes a better approximation.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{updated_secant.pdf}
    \caption{Moving points closer together results in a more accurate estimation of the
    tangent line}
    \label{fig:updated_secant}
\end{figure}

As points $p$ and $g$ come closer together in Figure \ref{fig:updated_secant}, we see the
line is a better approximation of the tangent line.\\

\emph{Note:} $p$ can't equal $q$ because two points are needed to make a line.\\

\textbf{Big idea for limits.} How close can two points get to each other without being the
same point? The solution is to let two points get infinitesimally close together without actually
equalling each other. If this is the case, then the secant will be identical to the
tangent. So a limit is letting something get infinitesimally close without touching it.

\subsubsection{Example of finding tangent line}

For function $f(x) = x^2$, can we find the tangent line at $(1, 1)$? 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We can think of a general second point of the form $q: (x, x^2)$
    \item Recall point slope formula: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
    \item For a tangent line, the formula is similar but we'd substitute in the slope of
        the tangent line: $y - y_1 = M_{tan}(x - x_1)$
    \item Substitute in the fixed point $(1, 1)$. 
    \item Make the line into a secant, and move $q$ closer to $(1, 1)$ to find the
        tangent.
    \item Derive a general slope for $M_{sec} = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$. This holds because
        we know the general form of $q: (x, x^2)$.
    \item As $Q \rightarrow P$, then $M_{sec} \rightarrow M_{tan}$.
    \item But notice that, in the general slope formula for $M_{sec}$, moving $q$ all the
        way to $p$ results in $0/0$, which doesn't work. 
    \item But also notice that the general slope formula for $M_{sec}$ can be simplified:

        \begin{align*}
            M_{sec} &= \frac{x^2 - 1}{x-1}\\
            &= \frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x-1}\\
            &= x + 1
        \end{align*}

    \item Remember, after a simplification, you don't get rid of domain restrictions. So,
        as $q \rightarrow p$, $M_{sec} = x + 1 \rightarrow 2$.
    \item But you are allowed to make a jump to make a claim that $M_{tan} = 2$. And
        solving for slope intercept form gives you the equation of a tangent line at point
        $(1, 1)$, which is $y = 2x - 1$.
