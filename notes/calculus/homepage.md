# Calculus

## Objective

I want to work towards a rich, deep understanding of calculus, which I perceive to be a
large part of the underpinning of probability theory, statistics, and modeling.

I want to strike an ideal balance of breadth and depth. Derivatives and integrals are key
(ie, function optimization). I anticipate I'll balance between working thorough rigorous
resources to establish a deeper, more thorough knowledge, and work through more
surface-level resources if I need to more quickly get a working understanding of some of
the concepts.

        to try to get to derivatives and integrals. If it seems like I'm missing too much
        important information by doing this, then I might just go slowly and pick up a
        more surface-level understanding of integrals and derivatives from other sources.
