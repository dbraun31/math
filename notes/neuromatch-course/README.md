# Neuromatch Academy: Computational Neuroscience

[Neuromatch Academy](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) is a three-week
workshop I'm attending in July, 2023, and this year's workshop is focused on teaching academics skills in computational
neuroscience. They have a fair bit of really great-looking background material to work
through before the course begins, and this space is dedicated to organizing my notes on
that material.
