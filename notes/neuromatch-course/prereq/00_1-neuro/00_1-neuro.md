# Intro

We're going over basic properties of the brain.

**Dale's Dogma.** The fact that neurotransmitters can either be excitatory or inhibitory.
In their words, "A neuron makes either excitatory or inhibitory synapses."

He shows some distrubtion of neuron connections to argue that the brain's complexity comes
not from the number of neurons but rather from the number of connections.

# Psychophysics

"The analysis of perceptual processes by studying the effect on a subject's experience or
behavior of systematically varying the properties of a stimulus along one or more physical
dimensions."

ie, relationship between stimulus and sensation.

**Why?** The precise measurement of perception enables one to form theories about
underlying neural representation.


Lots of really interesting detail that was very fast and I didn't take notes on. But she
went over psychophysics methods such as measuring just noticable differences (with
staircase functions) and measuring subjective equivalence as rigorous ways to measure
the function between sensation and perception.
