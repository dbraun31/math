\chapter{Plausible Reasoning}

\begin{quotation}
    The actual science of logic is conversant at present only with things either centrain,
    impossible, or entirely doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have to reason on.
    Therefore the true logic for this world is the calculus of Probabilities, which takes
    account of the magnitude of the probability which is, or ought to be, in a reasonable
    man's mind.
    \hfill -- James Clerk Maxwell (1850)
