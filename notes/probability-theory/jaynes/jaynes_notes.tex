\chapter*{Prologue}

\begin{quotation}
    A scientist who has learned how to use probability theory directly as extended logic
    has a great advantage in power and versatility over one who has learned only a
    collection of unrelated \emph{ad hoc} devices. As the complexity of our problems
    increases, so does this relative advantage.\\
    \hfill -- Edwin Jayes, p. xxviii
