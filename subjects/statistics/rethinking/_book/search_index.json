The major topics covered are: Bayesian data analysis Model comparison Multilevel models Graphical causal models Maybe the most interesting discussion was around Figure 1.2 and all the problems in inference that arise due to the relationships between hypotheses, process models, and statistical models. Each can imply more than one of the other, and so a strict falsification approach is problematic. Each chapter comes along with a YouTube video lecture. I’ll take more real-time notes along with this first lecture below. The YouTube lecture for chapter one is here. 1.1 Lecture notes He’s arguing that the argument between Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics is only had by boomer statisticians. The real discussion is about causal inference. For statistical models to produce scientific insight, they require additional scientific (causal) models. The causes for the data don’t come from the data, they must come from theory. 1.1.1 What is causal inference? Two key aspects to understanding causal inference: Prediction of intervention. Knowing a cause means being able to predict the consequences of an intervention. More than just prediction per se. Imputation of missing observations. Knowing a cause means being able to construct unobserved counterfactual outcomes. Makes me think of simulating a model where you can play out many different scenarios. Even “purely” descriptive research needs to consider causal modeling. Any time you’re trying to draw inferences about a population from a sample, you need to consider factors that might have caused the sample to be the way that it is. 1.1.1.1 Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) These are essentially box-and-arrow causal models of a process. We’re saying that changing \\(X\\) will induce some change in \\(Y\\); changing \\(Y\\), however, will not impact \\(X\\). And we make no assumptions about the nature of the relationship (eg, whether it is linear). The goal is to see what insight can be gleaned with these relatively few assumptions, before making more assumptions about functional relationships (which affords much more scientific power), and indeed DAGs are a good precursor to more specific process models. 25 min "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
