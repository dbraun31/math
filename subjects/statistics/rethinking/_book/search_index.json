A small world is a self-contained logical model of the world. We need to be able to verify the model’s logic, ensuring it performs as expected under favorable conditions. He says Bayesian models have reasonable claims to optimality: no model could make better use of the data, assuming the model of reality is an accurate description. The large world is the broader context in which the model is deployed. The broader context often presents surprises. And the small world is always an imperfect representation of the larger world. Aims of the chapter. Here we’re concerned with the small world. We’ll focus on probability theory, then see how Bayesian inferences arises naturally from this perspective. We then see Bayesian statistical models; then how to animate the model to produce estimates. A short note about how real organisms use heuristics as adaptive shortcuts and aren’t fully “Bayesian” in their logic; nor should they be. 2.1 The garden of forking data "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
